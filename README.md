To try and add:

- Add other solving algorithms, like breadth-first search or A*
- Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
- Time the various algorithms and see which ones are the fastest
- Make it a game where the user chooses directions
  - If you made it a game, allow the user to race an algorithm
- Generalize the amount of dimensions
